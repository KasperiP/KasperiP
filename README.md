## Hello, nice to meet you ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¤ 

I am Kasperi Pohtinen, a software developer specializing in web development, based in [Naantali, Finland](https://www.google.com/search?q=naantali+finland). I originally come from Joensuu, a city on the east side of Finland, where I grew up. I then moved to Tampere for my studies and, after a few years, relocated to Southwest Finland for full-time work. In my free time, I have a bit of an obsession with running, and I also have a great appreciation for nature. It keeps my mind sharp and provides a balance to all the coding I do. There must be balance in everything, right?

Over the next few years, my aim is to enhance my web development skills and transition towards becoming a full-stack developer. Additionally, I am currently pursuing my computer science studies at the [University of Tampere](https://www.tuni.fi/en).

I'm always eager to learn from others and share my own experiences. Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kpohtinen) if youâ€™re interested in exchanging ideas or discussing potential collaborations! I also follow my GitHub feed on a daily basis, so if you are doing interesting open-source work, give me a follow on GitHub. I will follow you back if you are building neat stuff! ðŸ’Ž
